  Ways to start DroneBridge modules & how to access logs generated by the
  started modules

# Startup & Logs

## Startup

All modules can be started manually but it is preferred to use `start_db_modules.py` script. On DroneBridge for Raspberry Pi the startup of modules is done by the `start_db` service. The source code sits inside the root directory of the repository. The service can be updated/registered using:

```bash
cp /home/pi/DroneBridge/start_db /etc/init.d/start_db
sudo update-rc.d -f start_db remove
sudo update-rc.d start_db defaults
```

The status of the DroneBridge modules can be checked using:

```bash
sudo /etc/init.d/start_db [status|start|stop]
```

or:

```bash
service start_db [status|start|stop]
```

## Logs

Since it is a service, all logs will be written to the journal. The logs can be viewed using one of the following commands:

```bash
journalctl -u start_db.service
```

```bash
systemctl | grep start_db | less
```
