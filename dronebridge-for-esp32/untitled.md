# Setup

![DroneBridge for ESP32 concept](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DroneBridge/ESP32/master/wiki/db_ESP32_setup.png)

### Features

* Bi-directional link: **MAVLink, MSP & LTM**
* Very low price: **~7€**
* Up to **150m** range
* **Weight: &lt;10 g**
* Supported by: **DroneBridge for Android \(app\), mwptools, QGroundcontrol, impload etc.**
* **Easy to set up**: Power connection + UART connection to flight controller
* **Fully configurable through easy to use web interface**
* **Parsing of LTM & MSPv2** for more reliable connection and less packet loss
* **Fully transparent telemetry downlink option** for continuous streams like MAVLink or and other protocol
* Reliable, low latency, light weight
* Upload mission etc.

Tested with: DOIT ESP32 module

### Setup

#### Flashing the firmware using the precompiled binarys

1. Download latest release from this repository or check out `db_esp32\releases` folder.
2. Get the [latest Flash Download Tools from Espressif](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/resources)
3. Settings
   * `bootloader.bin 0x1000`
   * `partitions_singleapp.bin 0x8000`
   * `dronebridge_esp32.bin 0x10000`
4. During flasing you might need to hold the "boot" button for 2-3 seconds because some drivers have issues with the process.
5. If you dont get it check out google or [this link](http://iot-bits.com/esp32/esp32-flash-download-tool-tutorial/)

#### Wiring

TODO

Connect UART of ESP32 to a 3.3V UART of your flight controller. Set the flight controller port to the desired protocol. \(Power the ESP32 module with a stable 5-12V power source\) **Check out manufacturer datasheet! Only some modules can take more than 3.3V/5V on VIN PIN**

#### Configuration

1. Connect to the wifi `DroneBridge ESP32` with password `dronebridge`
2. In your browser type: `dronebridge.local` \(Chrome: `http://dronebridge.local`\) or `192.168.2.1` into the address bar
3. Configure as you please and hit `save`

**Configuration Options:**

* \*\*`Wifi password`: Up to 64 character long
* \*\*`UART baud rate`: Same as you configured on your flight controller
* `GPIO TX PIN Number` **&** `GPIO RX PIN Number`**: The pins you want to use for TX & RX \(UART\). See pin out of manufacturer of your ESP32 device** Flight controller UART must be 3.3V or use an inverter.\*\*
* `UART serial protocol`: MultiWii based or MAVLink based - configures the parser
* `Transparent packet size`: Only used with 'serial protocol' set to transparent. Length of UDP packets
* `LTM frames per packet`: Buffer the specified number of packets and send them at once in one packet
* `MSP & LTM to same port`: Split MSP & LTM stream or send both to same port. Set to `Yes` if you want to use `mwptools`. Set to `No` if you use DroneBridge software \(app etc.\)

\*\* Require restart/reset of ESP32 module

### Use with DroneBridge for Android

Use the Android app to display live telemetry data. Mission planning capabilities for MAVLink and MSP will follow.

### Compile yourselfe \(developers\)

You will need the Espressif SDK: esp-idf + toolchain. Check out their website for more info and on how to set it up. The code is written in pure C using the esp-idf \(no arduino libs\).

Compile and flash by running: `make`, `make flash`
